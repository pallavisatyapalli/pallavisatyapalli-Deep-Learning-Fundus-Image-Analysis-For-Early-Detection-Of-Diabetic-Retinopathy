# 🩺 Deep Learning Fundus Image Analysis for Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy

## 📌 Project Overview

**Deep Learning Fundus Image Analysis for Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy** is a medical imaging project that leverages deep learning techniques to automatically detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) from retinal fundus images.

Diabetic Retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among diabetic patients. Early detection plays a crucial role in preventing severe vision loss. This system uses a pre-trained **Xception Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify retinal abnormalities efficiently and accurately.
